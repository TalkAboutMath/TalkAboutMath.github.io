									<h1>The Four Color Theorem<br />
									</h1>
									<p>Even the mightiest of maps can be colored with 4 crayons</p>
								</header>
								
								<p>Have you ever wondered: “If I colored maps for a living, what is the least number of colored crayons I would need to do my job?”</p>

								<p>If yes (or even if you haven’t), then the Four Color Theorem is for you!!  </p>

									<dl>
										<dt>The Four Color Theorem revolves around a simple statement:</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>You can color any map with at most four colors.</p>
										</dd>
									</dl>
								<div class="image main"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/geoawesomeness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Four-color-map-2.png?resize=1119%2C671&ssl=1" alt="" /></div>


								<p>This statement was put forth in 1852 by Francis Guthrie when he wondered what the minimum number of colors would be needed in order to color a map of New England—but how do we know this statement is true for every single map?</p>

								<p>Disproving this theorem is very easy. All you have to do is find one map where it requires a total of 5 colors to make every region in the map a different color from all the regions touching it. (Note, a bunch of region meetings at a point technically doesn’t count as touching).</p>

								<p>Proving this statement is universally true, on the other hand, is very difficult as it requires proof that every single map that can be possibly created obeys this rule. There have been many attempts to prove this theorem since 1852, but most all of them have been found to have some fallacy. In the last few decades, however, there has emerged a generally accepted proof for this theorem that includes the use of computer programs as a part of the proof (although there is still some disagreement over if it is a definitive proof)!</p>

								<p>The beauty of this theorem is that you can try it yourself! As long as you have something to write with and something to write on, you can make maps of your own and color them with only four colors if you’re clever. </p>
								<p>If you’re feeling bored, you can even try to come up with the first map that requires 5 colors and throw the math community into a frenzy!</p>

								<p>Below, I included a program written by Adrianus Kleemans. This allows you to construct any wild map you want with straight lines, and then the program will automatically figure out how to color your map with only four colors or less. It’s really fun to play around with and see how even ridiculously complex maps can be colored in to abide by this simple rule! </p>
